THEME : TINY CREATURES

1
automation game like satisfactory but with nano machines

2
automation game like satisfactory but with small "minions" doing the work, you start with a minion replicator, or 10 minions or something like that


3
getting over it like game with a caterpillar, you control contraction and extension of the caterpillar, and you can grab onto things if you fall
the goal is getting to the top to make a coccon and become a butterfly
eating stuff make you bigger, maybe needed for later parts/or just makes it easier instead of being required


maybe have a hunger meter, need to eat leaves on the way, might just be a chore though...
