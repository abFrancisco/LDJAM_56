THEME : TINY CREATURES

1
automation game like satisfactory but with nano machines

2
automation game like satisfactory but with small "minions" doing the work, you start with a minion replicator, or 10 minions or something like that


3
getting over it like game with a caterpillar, you control contraction and extension of the caterpillar, and you can grab onto things if you fall
the goal is getting to the top to make a coccon and become a butterfly
eating stuff make you bigger, maybe needed for later parts/or just makes it easier instead of being required


maybe have a hunger meter, need to eat leaves on the way, might just be a chore though...

4 
circuit building game, named NanoMachines(tiny creatures)
works kinda like zachtronics games,theres a score at the end and you want to be above a certain threshold

goal is makin a circuit board meeting the level requirements
requirements can be:
	space (_x_ grid limiting space for building)
	cost
	materials
	*optional* time to build
there are 2 types of nano machines
destructors and constructors, *optional* maybe a welder too??

destructors can dig paths in the copper board
*optional* they can also destroy a fraction of some parts, for example, 
	lets say theres a memory chip with 16kbits of storage, 
	the destroyer can destroy 1/2 of it to keep 8kbits, 
	this would be like recycling, it would refund half the price/cost of that fraction of the part


constructors can construct parts

parts are made up of smaller modules????, mayube this is too hard
